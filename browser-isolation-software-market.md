<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Browser Isolation Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>Web Base</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Browser isolation software market primarily comprises two types: cloud-based and web-based solutions. Cloud-based browser isolation leverages remote servers to execute web activities, keeping end-user devices safe from potential threats. It typically offers scalable, easy deployment options and centralized management. On the other hand, web-based solutions run directly within the user's browser, offering a more integrated experience. While they provide immediate access to isolated browsing, they may rely more on the existing infrastructure's security. Both types aim to enhance cybersecurity while protecting sensitive data during web interactions.</p></p>
