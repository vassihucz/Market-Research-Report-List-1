<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial Remolding Orthoses (CROs) are specialized devices designed to correct abnormal head shapes in infants. The market is divided into two main types: active helmets and passive helmets. Active helmets use adjustable components to actively mold the head as the child grows, providing dynamic support. In contrast, passive helmets feature a fixed design that passively guides head shape correction without adjustments. Both types aim to ensure optimal cranial development and enhance the childâ€™s overall appearance and health.</p></p>
