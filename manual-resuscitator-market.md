<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Resuscitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-Inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual resuscitator market includes two primary types: self-inflating resuscitators and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators are devices that automatically refill after each compression, providing a consistent supply of oxygen to patients. They are commonly used in emergencies due to their ease of use. In contrast, flow-inflating resuscitators require a continuous gas supply, allowing for better control over ventilation and breath pressure. These are often employed in controlled environments like hospitals, where precise administration of oxygen is essential.</p></p>
